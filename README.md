**Adaptation of the famous spaceship arcade games. Abroad your spaceship survive within an asteroid field.**

SpaceDodger is the first game i have created in Java, i have made it on my spare time while i was learning Java at university. I believe slick2d and game creation is one of the reason why i greatly love jvm and OOP concentps, as i discovered it in the most funny way possible.

I have created it entierly myself from scratch.
I have used external resources for :
- Slick2D : basic java 2D rendering library
- sprite sheets from internet
- musics from internet

The asteroids are created in a random manners to create replayability and the dificulty will increase over time. In any cases, a path will be available for you to pass through.
